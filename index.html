I am from Bangladesh. I have completed my Higher Secondary Certificate. Now, I am pursuing Bachelors of Mechanical Engineering in RMIT University. I can speak three different languages which includes my mother-language Bangla, English and Spanish. I find playing badminton and table tennis interesting although I spend most of my leisure time with my car.

									<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

								<ul style="list-style-type:square">
									<li>
										<p align="justify">My interest in IT is not too old. I had a course namely, Information and Communication Technology in my 9th grade. Throughout that course, I became familiar with the IT world. I enjoyed doing the coursework related to web development. Though the course was a very basic one but it played an important role to follow up my newest interest.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p align="justify">Choosing an education provider was one of the toughest decision but there are numerous reasons behind choosing RMIT University as my education provider. One of the reasons which played a vital role was the course structure, research facilities and infrastructures of RMIT intrigued me most. I firmly believe that, the facilities provided by RMIT will provide me a world class education opportunity in order for me to enhance my potential skills and abilities. RMIT will offer me further experiences to implement my education into real life, increasing my ability to solve problems and teamwork skills.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p align="justify">I will be required to study core subjects of Mechanical Engineering, mainly, Engineering Mathematics, Statics and Dynamics, Design of Machine Elements and others relevant subjects. These courses will teach me about the machines and mechanisms the world runs on. The world is mostly dependent on different types of industrialization process and I will get to learn the core elements of industrialization process through this well-structured course.</p>

									<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
									<p align="justify">Link of one of the ideal jobs: <a href> https://www.seek.com.au/job/36873746?type=standard </a><br><br>
									The position of the job is a design engineer. A design engineer basically makes a collaboration between optimum quality with minimum costing. The task can be very challenging in times and that is what appeals me the most as I enjoy working under certain circumstances. <br><br>
									Considering the requirements of the job I need to have some expertise. Most importantly, I need to be very proficient with CAD. The other skills required is to comprehend customer needs and applying them in the product through engineering specification. Keeping these in mind, I need to have some qualities such as great communication skill, combining needs with engineering, handling my workloads, documentation etc. I degree in Mechanical Engineering is preferred with an experience of 2-3 years in the relevant field. <br><br>
									I am currently pursuing my Bachelors of Mechanical Engineering. I have a good expertise on communication and documentation. I am learning Catia V6 for CAD and in the future I intend to get some hands on experience with other software. <br><br>
									With the aim of get into the position, I need to complete my graduation. After graduation, I will try to work in a manufacturing plant where I can achieve real world experience and be able to confront the challenges I am going to face in the future. <br><br>

										<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
											<p align="left">Myer Briggs test result &emsp;&ensp;&ensp;: &emsp; <b>ISTJ-The Duty Fulfiller </b> <br>
											Learning Style test result &emsp;: &emsp; <b> Tactile/Kinesthetic </b> <br>
											Big Five Personality Test &emsp;&nbsp;: &emsp; <b> Extroversion </b> <br> <br> <br>
											</p>
											<p align="justify">	
											The above mentioned test result is an exact picture of me. I strongly consent with the test results and I reckon the result will be a guidance for me to be more interactive within groups.<br> <br> 
											As these results show that I am mostly introvert, I will try to work on my performance while working in groups. I will try to be as much helpful as I can and give any kind support to my group needs. <br> <br>
											While forming a team, I will try to balance up the team in a perfect combination. I will make sure the qualities which lack inside me, will be dealt with one of my group members. <br> <br>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<p align="justify">The project is about making a mobile app which will immediately assist a sick person with it’s prerecorded solutions. The app will be a medical assist to people who are unable to go to a doctor instantly for some reason and will give a temporary solution to the user’s illness. The app will be useful in emergency situations only.<br><br>
									Back in my country, there are a lot of people who do not have the privilege to see a doctor in case of emergency. From this problem I came up with an idea of making an app which can be a remedy to this problem. If people can get some temporary solution for their illness, they may go to the nearest doctor for treatment. In addition, the app may be used to look for the best consultant and make an appointment with him in a convenient time. <br><br>
									The app will be programmed in a way to serve its users the best way possible. From the start, it will ask the user to enter general information. The general information may include name, age, sex, address, height, weight etc. After that the user needs to enter detailed symptoms of his/her problem. The app will store the data collected from the user and analyze them to give a final solution. The app will store the data for future reference. The symptoms will be taken from user through a series of questions. The questions will be programmed with the consultancy of some doctors. If the situation is not familiar with the app, it will suggest the person to consult with a doctor. With that in mind, the app can arrange an appointment for you of the nearest doctor available. It can also send a paramedic team in case of extreme emergency.  But if the app can find a solution for the given problem, it will ask the user if he/she already has the medicines related to the illness. If not, there will be a home delivery service of medicine at the user’s address.<br><br>
									The software can be built with any mobile app maker. But for analyzing the symptoms some consultancy with doctors is required. The list of questions and answers to those can be written in any platform. No specific equipment is needed to create the software. <br><br>
									If the idea of app can be executed with the feedback from users, I think it can make a huge difference in someone’s life. The people living in isolated area or with little privilege can find it very helpful in times. <br><br>
